# Overview
This is my submission for the receipt processor challenge that is part of the Fetch application process.

Challenge details are here: https://github.com/fetch-rewards/receipt-processor-challenge

## Implementation
This project is written in Go.

Run it by executing `go run .` from the project's base directory. It will start a web server listening on `http://localhost:8080`.

## Disclaimer
This project is my first time using Go. My current main language is Java. I tried to follow idiomatic Go practices but I probably missed some things, if parts of my code are weird that's probably why.
